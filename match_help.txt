Things To Consider:
1. Did you use struct* wp = work; instead of &work[i]?
2. Did you use &work[i] instead of struct* wp = work;?
3. Is this really a for loop?
4. Is this really a while loop?
5. Have you tried a switch statement instead of if/else?
6. Have you tried different scopes for variable declaration?
7. Have you tried doing a (type) C-style cast to signed/unsigned?
8. Two branches in a row? It's either the same check twice, or a switch statement.
9. If you need a stw instead of a stwx, check logic flow, you might need a break/return.
10. Have you tried sticking that weird constant in a variable? This compiler is dumb 
11. Very weird copying block using u32s? It's probably a raw struct copy, check for ptr=offset-4;copy ptr+4
